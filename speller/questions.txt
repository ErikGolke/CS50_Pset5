0.  Pneumonocultramicroscopicsilocovolcaniconiosis is another name for silocosis, a disease resulting from exposure to silica dust.

1.  getrusage() returns resource usage statistics.

2.  struct rusage has 16 variable members.

3.      We pass before and after by reference instead of by value because it is both quicker and cheaper
    to point to the structs than it is to recreate them.
    
4.    Main goes about reading words from a file by checking to see if the file opened correctly and 
    entering a for loop that begins at the first character pointed to by fp, increments it by one character, 
    and stops at the EOF marker. First, it stores the character in variable "c" and checks to see if the character is alphabetical, 
    or an apostraphe that is not at the start of the word, if so, it adds the character to the word array at index location, and 
    increments the index counter. The loop then checks if the word is too long, and if so, returns 0 and prepares to read a new word.
    If the character is a digit, the loop restarts and prepares for a new word. If the for loop does not encounter an alphabetic or 
    digit character, and index is greater than 0, then that means that the loop has found a whole word. It then adds the null 
    terminator and increments the word counter. Finally, the loop benchmarks the time taken to check the accuracy of the spelling of
    the word, updates the benchmark,  prints the word if misspelled, and increments the misspelling counter.

5.      We use fgetc instead of fscanf because fgetc reads one character at a time,  whereas fscanf reads everything until it encounters 
    whitespace, which could lead to the function saving unwanted information like punctuation.
    
6.  The parameters to check and load are declared as const to prevent any changes being made to the characters pointed to.
